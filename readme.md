Self-Organization by Design II
==============================

This is the Repo of [Self-Organisation by Design (SOBD)][1] â€“ [Part II][2]  
It contains Processing sketches and exercises for the workshop at Bauhaus-Uni Weimar.

## Topics

1. [Physical Geometry](1__physical_geometry)
2. [Chemical Geometry](2__chemical_geometry)
3. [Folding and Filling](3__folding_and_filling)
4. [Physics Libraries](4__physics_libraries)

## Special Feature

Feat. the [CanvasCam Library](5__canvascam_library). 

## Libraries

Libraries and tools we will explore:

| Libs              | Description                                                |
