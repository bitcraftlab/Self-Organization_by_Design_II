## Demo

###### Cellular Physics

- [A Flock of Blocks](demo/a_flock_of_blocks) simulates the interaction of multi-cell units in a discrete universe, inspired by TETRIS.
- [DrumSound](demos/DrumSound) – a continuous cellular automaton simulaties the spreading of waves on the surface of a drum – by Asher Salomon
- [MouseDrum](demos/mouse_drum) – extended version of the *DrumSound* sketch

###### DIY Physics in 2D

- [Blocks](demo/blocks) – a simple world of 2D blocks physics – by Asher Salomon
- [Shape Spring](demo/shapespring) is a very good example of 2D shape-physics – by Asher Salomon.

###### DIY Physics in 3D

- [Biomechanics](demo/Biomechanics) 3D stick-figure physics – by Asher Salomon.
- [Inner Tube](demo/Toroid) 3D soft-body physcis – by Asher Salomon.


## Exercises

###### 1D Physics

Have a look at the [Continuous 1D](exercise/continouos_1d) physics sketch

- How do the two chemicals in the sketch interact?
- What does this remind you of
- Play with the variables

Diffusion currently only takes one neighboring cell into account.  
Can you improve this?

###### 2D Physics

Have a look at the [Bee Swarm](exercise/bee_swarm) sketch

- What kind of physics is already implemented?
- Add gravity to the sketch
- Provide the bees with energy
- Change the shape of the bees, and add collision detection
