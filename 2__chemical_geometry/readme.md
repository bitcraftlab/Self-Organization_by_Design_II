## Theory

## Demo

###### Swarm Chemistry

- [Tapeworm](demo/tapeworm) – emergent behaviour from a simple rule: follow your predecessor
- [Magnetic Bubbles](demo/magnetic) – emergent behaviour from a simple rule: opposite charges attract each other
- [Bouncing Bubbles](demo/bouncing) – multi-color swarm chemistry

###### Diffusion Limited Aggregation

- [DLA Branching](dla_branching) – a simple example of grid-based Diffusion Limited Aggregation – growing branches rather than pixels

###### Image Based Chemistry
 
 - Image Based DLA – by Diana Lange
 - [Video Loops](video_loops) – this sketch shows how to use a common interface to let you work with animated images from animated gifs, ogg videos, webcam input etc.

## Exercise

###### 2D Chemistry

- Think of a structure you would like to create 
- How can you encode the structure in attraction-repulsion rules?
- Create your own 2D chemistry

###### Aggregation

Create your own variant of Diffusion Limited Aggregation.  

*Things to try*

- Add a force field to control the DLA
- Change the number of contacts a particle needs before it freezes
- Change the number of times a frozen cell needs to be contacted before a particle can attach to it
- Create a multi-color DLA, with color-dependent rules for aggregation
