Folding and Filling
====================

## Theory

[Folding and Filling](theory)

## Demo

###### Random Walks

- [Random Loop](random_loop) – a random walk that loops back to where it started

###### Space Filling Curves

- [Fractal Shuffle](fractal shuffle)  – shuffling pixels along a fractal curve.  
  Nice example of how to map 1D liniear space to 2D fractal space and back.

###### 3D Folding

- [Rubik's Snake](demo/rubiks_snake) – folding of connected prisms, inspired by Rubik's snake puzzle


## Exercises

###### Filling

Have a look at the [Filling Exercise](demo/filling_exercise)

- Modify the flood-fill algorithm to walk in random directions
- Modify the flood-fill algorithm to create curly walks
- Export your filling walk as Freeman-Code and save it as string.

###### Folding

- Import your  walk and display it
- use your walk to create a self-folding structure
- Create a molecule sequence that assembles by attraction forces
